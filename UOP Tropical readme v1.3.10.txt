MOO3 Unofficial Patch Mod Tropical VERSION

 Since the UO Metapatch attempt has well and truly died, I have decided to try and pick up the pieces myself. The main focus of the UO Metapatch was to make a mod that fixed MOO3 enough so that it played as it was intended to play. I have put together a mod that incorporates all the fixes for MOO3 currently available, primarily as a first stop for people trying to get MOO3 working. This will be Stage 1, now renamed to 'Vanilla'. I will expand it later to become a more encompasing mod, but each stage will remain independant.


*** MOO3 Unofficial Patch Mod Tropical V1.3.10 ***
 
 PURPOSE : To produce a mod to take the place of another official patch from QSI. It should fix all known bugs in the game, and change nothing else.
