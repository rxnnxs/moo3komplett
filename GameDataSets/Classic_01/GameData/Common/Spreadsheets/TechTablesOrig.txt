These devices actually decouple target particles from their molecular bonds by inducing local harmonic resonance, and then construct the desired materials using the collected atoms. This process results in materials with a purity level far exceeding what would otherwise be possible, maximizing their structural properties and therefore reducing the amount of material required. Using these collectors improves the mineral conversion rate of all manufacturing DEAs."		340
Energy Reclamation	TAEnrgRc	TBEnrgRc	None	Achieve	EnergyRc	Achieve	Energ_32	TFMinExt	None	ManuConv+=1											Energy Reclamation	Energy Reclamation reduces the overall energy consumption and consequent operation cost required for manufacturing and refinement processes. Energy Reclamation systems involve numerous tiny energy collectors capable of absorbing part of the energy lost or released during material processing on a molecular scale. The collectors can release this stored energy as electrical current or a variety of other useful forms. Energy Reclamation improves the conversion rate of minerals into processed materials.		341

The scanners are not true mind-readers; however, they can home in on the most fundamental aspect of a mind, its identity. Whether the person is a target for assassination or merely a guard with appropriate access to a target facility, neural scanners simplify many espionage actions by reducing the amount of time and effort required to search for assets. New agents exhibit increased proficiency at tasks that are primarily offensive in nature."

It allows the wearer to blend into most surroundings, greatly improving the agent's ability to evade detection and capture. The suit considerably improves an agent's defensive and evasive capabilities."

This is often limited to sensing the true feelings of nearby beings -- such as goodwill or malice, deceit or honesty. However, even this limited extra-sensory perception can make a world of difference to an agent conducting a covert mission in the field. Telepathic Training improves an agent's capabilities in almost any situation, both in accomplishing an objective and in escaping undetected."

Agents with psionic enhancement can influence the thoughts of those around them. This allows an agent to pass through secured areas literally unnoticed by guards, for example. (""We don't need to see his identification. You can go about your business. Move along."") Psionics makes agents both more effective at conducting missions and at extricating themselves from a compromised position. Psionic agents exhibit considerably improved capabilities in any covert operation."

The Xeno-Survivor Academy is a set of additional training sessions for new agents where they learn how to survive without outside support when necessary. This includes addressing personal, physical needs as well as detecting and evading hostiles. As a group, spies with this training tend to survive more missions and return home safely than those agents in the field without Xeno-Survivor training."

This allows the agent to appear as a nondescript member of one of the target civilization's species. Mutagens allow agents in danger of capture to alter their appearance drastically within moments, better enabling them to evade or mislead their pursuers. Agents enhanced with Mutagens enjoy substantially higher success and survival rates than those without."

Often, despite the will to serve, agents have reservations about some of the important tasks that they might be expected to perform. Training Resistance Compensators help alleviate these reservations and remove squeamishness, thus allowing agents to be trained in the necessary skills more quickly. The time to recruit and train a spy for field work is reduced."

Resisting these stresses while remaining loyal to the civilization that put the agent in that very position is what Deep Loyalty Indoctrination is all about. During training and between missions, agents are reminded of the reasons they risk such situations and how their civilization benefits from, and appreciates, these efforts. This is driven into agents in such a manner as to be recalled even more vividly as the agent's stress level increases, thus ensuring they will remember their loyalty even under interrogation or torture. An agent receiving this conditioning is somewhat less likely to break down under stress or interrogation."
Base Fear Indoctrination	TAFearIn	TBFearIn	None	Achieve	FearIndc	Achieve	SocSc_28	Intelligence	None	SpLoyal += 5											Base Fear Indoctrination	SpLoyal += 5	"Base Fear Indoctrination modifies the psyche of agents at an incredibly fundamental level. The negative aspects of the fear response -- hesitation, indecision, and panic -- are almost totally stricken from the agent's fear response, replaced with positive aspects such as determination and improvisation. Any innate positive responses to fear (such as the human adrenaline response) are reinforced. Agents with this indoctrination are much less likely to fail under stress, or talk when being interrogated or tortured."

Nonlinear Thinking	TANonLin	TBNonLin	None	Achieve	NonLinTh	Achieve	SocSc_23	Intelligence	None	SpOff += 5											Nonlinear Thinking	SpOff += 5	An agent in a compromised position often escapes only by successfully doing what pursuers fail to anticipate. Nonlinear Thinking involves a series of training scenarios that encourage the agent to gain the upper hand in various situations by finding unobvious solutions to the problem. Agents training in these thought processes are less likely to be identified or caught.

The Psi-signature Dampening Field shields an agent's mind from such equipment, registering the agent as someone with proper respect and wariness of the security forces using such equipment. Agents equipped and trained with these devices are much less likely to be spotted or captured."
Automated Criminal Background Checks	TACrmBck	TBCrmBck	None	Achieve	CrmBackg	Achieve	SocSc_20	Intelligence	None	SpDef += 5											Automated Criminal Background Checks	SpDef += 5	Enemy agents will routinely pass through various security procedures using falsified identification. Automated Criminal Background Checks covertly improve even the most casual-appearing identification checks (such as those conducted when purchasing goods from a private store) to include a check against the civilization's list of known criminals. Any matches are directed to nearby security forces without alerting the suspect. Enemy spies are less likely to escape detection and capture when these checks are put in place.

If their profile matches that of any known criminal, a silent alert is issued to the nearest security forces. The Database makes the detection and capture of enemy agents much easier."
Disguised Freighters	TADisFrt	TBDisFrt	None	Achieve	DisFreit	Achieve	Const_19	Intelligence	None	SpInsert += 5											Disguised Freighters	SpInsert += 5	"One of the oldest and most effective ways to enter and leave any without proper authorization is to hide within some other, authorized transportation. When an agent needs to enter or leave a star system discreetly, a candidate freighter is temporarily modified with a shielded compartment. If possible, this is done without even the crew's knowledge, by placing the compartment in an inaccessible area, such as within a bulkhead. This makes it easier for an agent to get into and out of another civilization's territory."
Backwater Navigation	TABckNav	TBBckNav	None	Achieve	BackWNav	Achieve	MthCm_17	Intelligence	None	SpInsert += 5											Backwater Navagation	SpInsert += 5	"Backwater Navigation is used to bypass closely-guarded borders. The agent uses transportation that either goes through a third civilization sharing a less-secure border with the target civilization, or uses a circuitous 'deep-space' approach to a backwater system. This makes it much easier for an agent to get into and out of unwelcoming territory unquestioned."
Border Scanning Array	TABrdScn	TBBrdScn	None	Achieve	BorderSn	Achieve	MthCm_34	Intelligence	None	SpRepel += 5											Border Scanning Array	SpInsert += -5	"Detecting the covert movement of spies outside of established traffic lanes is difficult since such agents generally rely on very stealthy, lone vessels. Border Scanning Arrays are deployed to combat this. The array consists of a series of automated remote scanning buoys that can detect the passage of even very small objects and faint engine emissions; any such detections alert rapid response forces to the area, as does any buoy that fails to respond to frequent automated status confirmations. Enemy agents find it harder to covertly enter or leave the civilization's territory."
Fine-Edge Scanning	TAEdgScn	TBEdgScn	None	Achieve	EdgeScan	Achieve	MthCm_43	Intelligence	None	SpRepel += 5											Fine-Edge Scanning	SpInsert += -5	Spies often travel into or out of territory by secreting themselves aboard legitimate merchant traffic. Fine-Edge Scanning makes use of high-resolution scanners to identify vessels whose hull structure and material exhibit modification of stock designs and sound engineering principles; these vessels are subjected to exhaustive onboard searches of the modified areas. Enemy agents have a much harder time sneaking into or out of friendly territory.

In practice, this is often not the case. Structured Interviewing changes this by ensuring that the right sorts of questions are asked during the candidate selection process and that the answers correspond with carefully crafted data analyzers to indicate various levels of suitability ranked by category. Thus, much of the subjective interview data garnered from a candidate can be used to obtain objective information and best fill job needs accordingly.

Meritocratic Incentives takes the process a step farther by re-emphasizing the importance of a candidate's qualifications and track record of on-the-job effectiveness, and putting them on prominent display both in the workplace and on job applications. This makes it is much harder to land a position by knowing the right person or through even more overt means such as bribery or extortion, and rewards those who achieve in the workplace with instant recognition that is of general societal regard.
